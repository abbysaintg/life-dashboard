# LIFE DASHBOARD

This WIP React web application is a one stop shop for all your life organizing needs. 

This app was created for my phase 2 project at Flatiron's Software Engineering Bootcamp and features a task manager, notebook, calendar, current time and weather, shortcuts, bookmarks, contacts, budget,  playlists, inspirational quote generator, light and dark modes, and more.
